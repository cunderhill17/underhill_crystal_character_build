                <h2>The History of Austen's Life</h2>
                <p class="lb-p-text">Born: December 16, 1775, Steventon, Hampshire England</p>
                <p class="lb-p-text">Died: July 18, 1817, Winchester, Hampshire England</p>
                <p class="lb-p-text">Jane Austen was born into a comfortably middle-class family in rural England. Her father, George Austen, was a clergyman, and her mother, Cassandra Austen, managed the household. Jane had six brothers and one sister, Cassandra, who was her closest companion and confidante.</p>
                <p class="lb-p-text">Austen received a modest formal education but was a voracious reader, with access to her father’s library and local lending libraries. From an early age, she wrote stories, plays, and parodies that displayed her keen observational skills and sharp wit.</p>
                <p class="lb-p-text">She lived most of her life in the countryside, moving with her family to different parsonages, and never married. Despite this, Austen’s novels explore romance, courtship, and marriage with unmatched insight into social structures, class mobility, and gender dynamics.</p>

                <p class="lb-p-text">Death Comes to Pemberley is a two-part British TV drama based on the 2011 novel by P.D. James, which imagines a murder mystery set in the world of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. The story picks up six years after the marriage of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, presenting a fusion of Austen’s Regency setting with a whodunit plot. While the characters and social milieu are directly drawn from Austen’s novel, the murder mystery is entirely P.D. James’ invention.</p>
